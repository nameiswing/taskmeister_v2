# Taskmeister

A bootcamp final capstone project.

## Summmary:

A task management app with admin(e.g. project mgr.) and client interface. The admin assigns tasks to members that can be seen on the client interface.

## Reminder

Don't forget to `cd folder-name` in your terminal and install dependencies using `npm install`. Aiming for third presenter tomorrow hehehe
